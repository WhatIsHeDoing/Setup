# Setup
## Introduction
Just a group of scripts that set up my common environments.

These can be re-run at any time, and will update pre-installed packages, runtimes and their associated packages, such as Ruby gems.

## Running
### Fedora
Just run `sudo sh setup.sh` from a terminal. This should be simple enough to adapt for another distro, e.g. Ubuntu.

### Windows
From an Administrator PowerShell terminal, run `.\setup.ps1`.
