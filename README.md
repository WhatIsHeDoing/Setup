# üíª Prep My OS

## üëã Introduction

This repository contains a group of scripts that set up my common environments.

These can be re-run at any time, and will update pre-installed packages, runtimes and their associated packages, plus global configuration.
Each script is designed to set up each Operating System (OS) using similar tools where possible,
such as [Starship] as the shell prompt and [VS Code] as the code editor,
to simplify moving between them.

Click on the [Ubuntu] version below to see it in action:

## üèÉ‚Äç Running

Run one of the following for your OS in your terminal of choice:

```sh
sh setup_debian.sh
sh setup_fedora.sh
sh setup_ubuntu.sh
.\setup_windows.ps1
```

## üîã Included

### üî® Tools

### ‚öôÔ∏è Scripts

Some tools require extra configuration or combinations to get the best from them.
The scripts below are available as aliases on Ubuntu and Windows:

| Global Alias | Meaning      | Description                                                            |
| ------------ | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ll`         | long listing | Comprehensive listing of files in the current directory                |
| `ff <term>`  | fuzzy find   | Fuzzy find of a search term for all files within the current directory |

## üß™ Testing

First, check the shell for problems using [ShellCheck]:

```sh
shellcheck *.sh
```

The majority of the Ubuntu setup script can be tested on any platform using a [Docker] container. Build and run it with:

```sh
docker build --progress=plain -f Dockerfile.ubuntu -t setup_ubuntu .
docker run -it setup_ubuntu
```

Similarly, the _entire_ Fedora script can be tested in Docker with:

```sh
docker build --progress=plain -f Dockerfile.fedora -t setup_fedora .
docker run -it setup_fedora
```

Containers should be verified with [Container Structure Tests], vulnerabilities with [Grype] and best practices with [Kics]:

```sh
grype setup_ubuntu
docker run -t -v /home/user/Setup:/Dockerfile checkmarx/kics:latest scan -p .
container-structure-test test --image setup_ubuntu --config container-structure-test.yml
```

## üí° Inspiration

The initial inspiration came from a post by [Scott Hanselman] on how to make a pretty prompt in Windows Terminal.
