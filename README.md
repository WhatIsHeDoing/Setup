# Setup

## 👋 Introduction

Just a group of scripts that set up my common environments.

These can be re-run at any time, and will update pre-installed packages, runtimes and their associated packages, and global configuration.

## 🏃‍ Running

### Fedora

Run `sudo sh setup.sh` from a terminal. This should be simple enough to adapt for another distro, e.g. Ubuntu.

### Windows

From an Administrator PowerShell terminal, run `.\setup.ps1`.

## 🤦‍ Limitations

Official Windows Store apps cannot be installed from the command line. As such, I recommend installing Windows Terminal (Preview) manually.
