# Setup

## 👋 Introduction

Just a group of scripts that set up my common environments.

These can be re-run at any time, and will update pre-installed packages, runtimes and their associated packages, plus global configuration.

## 🏃‍ Running

```sh
sudo sh debian_setup.sh # Debian
sudo sh fedora_setup.sh # Fedora
.\setup.ps1 # Windows Terminal
```
